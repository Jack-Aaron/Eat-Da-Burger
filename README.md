## Usage
This application uses Handlebars formatting, MySQL databases and Heroku cloud hosting. User can input a "Burger" via the form. This will load the "Burger" into the back-end table of Burgers that are ready to be "Eaten," and subsequently displayed on the left side of the screen. When user clicks the "Devour" button, the table will be updated accordingly, and the "Burger" will move from the left side to the right-sided list to show that it has been DEVOURED.
